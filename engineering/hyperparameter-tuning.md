# Noise Scheduling $$\eta$$

In the context of diffusion models, eta $$\eta$$ is a hyperparameter that controls the noise schedule during sampling.

**It determines the strength of the noise added at each step of the diffusion process.**

-A value of $$\eta = 1.0$$ corresponds to the standard DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models) noise schedule, where a predefined amount of noise is added at each step. This introduces more stochasticity into the sampling process, allowing for more diverse and creative image generation.
